What makes good documentation?
*********************************

Let's briefly look at some general guidelines on how to create 
effective documentation.

Why care about documentation?
=============================

- **Make AI real**: We want clients to use our software effectively. Only great documentation allows great software to have real impact. 
- **Professional delivery**: Comparatively little work spent on good documentation results in a much more impressive and professional delivery. In particular, it bridges the gap between technical and non-technical deliverables.
- **Brand identity**: Consistent documentation should be part of the brand identity.
- **Docs for other Faculty team members**: Consistent documentation across projects allows new team members to get up to speed quickly

Components of good documentation?
=================================

Documentation relies on a good structure and a consistent style.

Structure
*********

Users consult documentation in different modes:

Instruction:
    * Learn how to use the software
    * Learn how to complete a certain procedure

Conceptual:
    * to help understand goals, principles and methods involved in completing a process or task

Reference:
    * to search for details when something has been forgotten or when something unexpected happens (troubleshooting)

Documentation has to be explicitly structured around these modes, and they all must be kept separate from each other.
This structure suggest the following four building blocks (see `here <https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/>`_):

Tutorials:
    * learning-oriented
    * allows the newcomer to get started
    * is a lesson
How-to guides:
    * goal-oriented
    * shows how to solve a specific problem/ complete a specific procedure
    * is a series of steps
Explanation:
    * understanding-oriented
    * explains (e.g. details of an algorithm)
    * Provides background and context
Reference:
    * information-oriented
    * describes the machinery
    * accurate and complete

Clearly, documentation of smaller projects might not have to include all these modes.

Style
*****

Documentation should be written in a consistent style. This includes, but is not limited to, a consistent use of

- active and passive voice
- highlighting
- inline code
- referencing (e.g. to other documents or figures)

This makes documentation more accessible and reflects the brand identity. You can find more details on that in the `Faculty style guide <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tTGrKN9TyWiehpv8zktWTy3RimB0201WKVktJ4zXkY0/edit#heading=h.hjn41g6h1itm>`_.
