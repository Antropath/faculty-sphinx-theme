Introduction

This document shows you how to set up Faculty branded documentation for 
Data Science projects. It is split into two main parts:

- general guidelines on how to create effective documentation
- a description of how you can use the `Faculty Sphinx theme <https://github.com/facultyai/faculty-sphinx-theme>`_ to create Faculty branded documentation in a few steps.


Background
==========

Faculty's Data Science projects are ambitious and the 
final deliverables to clients often involve large code bases. This 
code can only have a real impact (make AI real) if clients can use all of its functionality effectively. 
The goal of this document is to take away the cognitive load of thinking about how to make 
good documentation at the end of a project. Ideally, it should enable project teams to create 
professional documentation in a few hours.

How to contribute
=================

If you want to contribute to Faculty's effort of creating world-class 
documentation, please talk to the DSS delivery team or email
